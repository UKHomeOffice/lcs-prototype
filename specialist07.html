				<h1 class="heading-xlarge">Ending a tenancy due to immigration status</h1>

				<h2 class="heading-medium">Summary</h2>
				<p>Information about ending a tenancy if you believe that someone living in a property you manage or own is not allowed to stay in England due to their immigration status.
				</p>

				<h2 class="heading-medium">Guidance</h2>
				<p>You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-tenant-right-to-rent-documents/who-to-check">check that someone can legally rent a residential property</a> before you rent to them under the Right to Rent scheme. </p>

				<p>If you know or have reasonable cause to believe that someone living in your property is not allowed to rent due to their immigration status (‘disqualified from renting’), you have a range of options to end the tenancy. A tenancy can be a verbal or written agreement. </p>
			</p>


			<div class="notice">
				<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-lg">
					<span class="visuallyhidden">Warning</span>
				</i>
				<strong class="bold-small">
					It is an offence to continue to rent your property to a disqualified person. You could face an unlimited fine or be sent to prison for up to 5 years.
				</strong>
			</div>
			<br>
			<p>You will have a defence against this offence if you take <a href="https://lcs-prototype.herokuapp.com/">reasonable steps within a reasonable period of time</a> to end the tenancy.</p>

			<p>This guidance will help you to:</p>
			<ul class="list-bullet">
				<li>end a tenancy with a disqualified person </li>
				<li>check if a person is still disqualified from renting</li>
				<li>tell the Home Office that a disqualified person has left your property</li>
			</ul>


			<h2 class="heading-medium"><a name="end">End a tenancy with a disqualified person</a></h2>

			<p>You may know that someone is disqualified from renting because:</p>
			<ul class="list-bullet">
			<li>they failed a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-tenant-right-to-rent-documents/further-checks">follow-up Right to Rent check</a> and you made a report to the Home Office</li>
			<li>you received a Notice of Letting to a Disqualified Person from the Home Office</li>
			</ul>
			<p> You have a range of options to end the tenancy with a disqualified person. You can:
</p>
		<ul class="list-bullet">
			<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/tenancy-agreements-a-guide-for-landlords/ending-a-tenancy">ask the disqualified person to leave</a> by giving them the agreed notice period as in the tenancy agreement</li>
			<li>start the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/evicting-tenants">eviction process</a> if they do not leave when their notice period expires</li>
			<li>use a <a href="#use">Notice of Letting to a Disqualified Person</a> to end the tenancy</li>
</ul>
			<p>If you have reasonable cause to believe that a disqualified person is living in your property you can also <a href="https://lcs-prototype.herokuapp.com/">request a Notice of Letting to a Disqualified Person from the Home Office</a> to confirm this. You can then use this to help you end the tenancy.</p>
			<br>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

			<h2 class="heading-medium"><a name="check">Check if a person is still disqualified from renting</a> </h2>

			<p>If you have received a Notice of Letting to a Disqualified Person  to confirm that someone living in your property is disqualified from renting, you may wish to <a href="https://lcs-prototype.herokuapp.com">check that the person is still disqualified from renting</a>. You may wish to do this if some time has passed since it was issued and you are using it to end a tenancy.</p>
			<br>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>


			<h2 class="heading-medium"><a name="tell">Tell the Home Office that a disqualified person has left your property</a></h2>
			<p><a href="https://lcs-prototype.herokuapp.com/">Let the Home Office know</a> when someone leaves your property following a Notice of Letting to a Disqualified Person. The Home Office will then update their records.</p>

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>


			<h2 class="heading-medium"><a name="use">Use a Notice of Letting to a Disqualified Person to end a tenancy</a></h2>

			<p>The Home Office may send you a Notice of Letting to a Disqualified Person (a ‘Notice’) to tell you that someone living in your property is disqualified from renting. This is section 33D of the Immigration Act 2014.</p>

			<p>The Home Office will also write to the person named on a Notice to tell them it has been sent.
If a person believes that they’ve been named in error on a Notice they should contact the Home Office, either through their usual case owner or reporting centre, or by calling the Immigration Public Enquiry line on 0300 1232241. </p>


			<p>In addition to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/tenancy-agreements-a-guide-for-landlords/ending-a-tenancy">asking the disqualified person to leave</a> by giving them the agreed notice period or starting the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/evicting-tenants">eviction process</a> if they do not leave, you can also use the Notice to help you end the tenancy. You can either:</p>

<ul class="list-bullet">
			<li><a href="#all">use a Notice that names all occupiers to end a tenancy</a> </li>
			<li><a href="#some">use a Notice that names some – but not all – occupiers to end a tenancy</a></li>
</ul>

			<h2 class="heading-small"><a name="all">Use a Notice that names all occupiers to end a tenancy</a></h2>

			<p>If you have received a Notice which names all occupiers, or multiple Notices which together name all occupiers, you have the additional option to use this to end the tenancy without a court order.</p>

			<p>To do this you should:</p>
			<ul class="list-bullet">
			<li>give your occupiers this <a href="#">prescribed form</a> to serve them notice [link]</li>
			<li>give your occupiers a copy of the Notice</li>
			<li>allow at least 28 days’ notice for them to leave</li>
</ul>

			<p>If the disqualified person does not leave voluntarily you can:</p>
			<ul class="list-bullet">
			<li>exclude them from the property peacefully after the notice has expired, for example by changing the locks on their room</li>
			<li>apply to the district registry of a High Court for a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/evicting-tenants/eviction-notices-and-bailiffs">warrant of possession</a> - this is a court order to ask enforcement officers to evict them</li>

			<p>You must not use violence or threats of violence to evict them as this is a criminal offence.</p>

			<h2 class="heading-small"><a name="some">Use a Notice that names some of the occupiers to end a tenancy</a></h2>
			<p>If you have a Notice which names some, but not all, of the occupiers, you have the option to use it to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/evicting-tenants/section-21-and-section-8-notices">end the tenancy with the disqualified person(s)</a> under section 8 of the Housing Act 1988. You may transfer the tenancy to someone else, once the disqualified person has left. You can do this using a deed of assignment.</p>

			<p>If you have reasonable cause to believe that other occupiers are also disqualified from renting you can <a href="https://lcs-prototype.herokuapp.com/">ask the Home Office for a Notice naming them</a>. If all occupiers are then named on a Notice, or multiple Notices, you can end the tenancy without a court order (see above ‘A Notice which names all occupiers’).</p>

			<p>If the tenancy is for a fixed term you can end it under section 33E of the Immigration Act 2014. If the fixed term has not expired, you can serve the disqualified person a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/evicting-tenants/section-21-and-section-8-notices">notice of seeking possession.</a> When this expires you can start court proceedings to take back your property. If the fixed term has expired and the disqualified person has not left your property, you can apply to the court for a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/evicting-tenants/possession-hearings-and-orders">possession order.</a></p>



			<h2 class="heading-medium"><a name="further">Further advice</a></h2>
			<p>Landlords and occupiers can seek legal advice from solicitors, housing advice centres or the <a href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/">Citizens Advice.</a></p>

			<p>Landlords can call the landlord’s helpline for general information about evicting a disqualified person. The helpline cannot talk about individual cases.</p>
