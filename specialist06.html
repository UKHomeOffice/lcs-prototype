				<h1 class="heading-xlarge">Ending a tenancy due to immigration status</h1>

				<h2 class="heading-medium">Summary</h2>
				<p>Information about ending a tenancy if you believe that someone you are renting a property to is not allowed to stay in England due to their immigration status.
				</p>

				<h2 class="heading-medium">Guidance</h2>
				<p>You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-tenant-right-to-rent-documents/who-to-check">check that someone can legally rent a residential property</a> before you rent to them under the Right to Rent scheme. </p>

				<p>If you believe that someone living in your property is not allowed to rent due to their immigration status (‘disqualified from renting’), you have a range of options to end the tenancy. A tenancy can be a verbal or written agreement.</p>

<p>You may know that someone is a disqualified from renting because:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
	<li>they failed a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-tenant-right-to-rent-documents/further-checks">follow-up Right to Rent check </a></li>
<li>you received a Notice of Letting to a Disqualified Person from the Home Office</li>
</ul>


			<div class="notice">
				<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle fa-lg">
					<span class="visuallyhidden">Warning</span>
				</i>
				<strong class="bold-small">
					It is an offence to knowingly continue to rent your property to a disqualified person. You could face an unlimited fine or be sent to prison for up to 5 years.
				</strong>
			</div>
			<br>
			<p>You will have a defence against this offence if you take <a href="https://lcs-prototype.herokuapp.com/">reasonable steps within a reasonable period of time</a> to end the tenancy.</p>

			<h2 class="heading-medium"><a name="end">End a tenancy with a disqualified person</a></h2>
			<!--  -->
<p>You have a range of options to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/tenancy-agreements-a-guide-for-landlords/ending-a-tenancy">end the tenancy</a> depending on its type and terms. In all cases, you must make sure that you give the disqualified person the agreed notice period.
</p>

<h3 class="heading-small">Evict a disqualified person</h3>
<p>You can start the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/evicting-tenants">eviction process</a> if you have given notice to a disqualified person and they don’t leave your property by the time their notice period runs out. You can also use a Notice of Letting to a Disqualified Person to help you evict a disqualified person.
</p>

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<h2 class="heading-medium"><a name="use">Use a Notice of Letting to a Disqualified Person to end a tenancy</a></h2>

<p>The Home Office may send you a Notice of Letting to a Disqualified Person (a ‘Notice’) to tell you that someone living in your property is disqualified from renting. This is under section 33D of the Immigration Act 2014. The Home Office will also write to the person named on a Notice to tell them it has been sent.</p>

<p>The Notice allows you to evict a disqualified person without a court order in certain circumstances, although you may end the tenancy through another route if you prefer. </p>

<p>You can <a href="https://lcs-prototype.herokuapp.com/">request a Notice from the Home Office</a> if you have reasonable cause to believe that a disqualified person is living in your property.
</p>

<p>If a person believes that they’ve been named in error on a Notice they should contact the Home Office, either through their usual case owner or reporting centre, or by calling the Immigration Public Enquiry line on 0300 1232241.</p>

<h3 class="heading-small">A Notice which names all occupiers</h3>
<p>If you have received a Notice which names all occupiers, or multiple Notices which together name all occupiers, you have the option to use this to end the tenancy without a court order.
</p>
<!-- 1 -->

<p>To do this you should:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li>give your occupiers this <a href="#">prescribed form</a> to serve them notice [link]</li>
<li>give your occupiers a copy of the Notice you received from the Home Office</li>
<li>allow at least 28 days’ notice for them to leave</li>
</ul>

<p>If the disqualified person does not leave by the time their notice period expires, you can:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li>exclude them from the property peacefully after the notice has expired, for example by changing the locks on their room</li>
<li>apply to the district registry of a High Court for a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/evicting-tenants/eviction-notices-and-bailiffs">warrant of possession</a> - this is a court order to ask enforcement officers to evict them. The High Court will need to see a copy of the Notice from the Home Office. </li>
</ul>

<p>You must not use violence or threats of violence to evict them as this is a criminal offence.</p>

<h2 class="heading-small"><a name="some">A Notice which names some of the occupiers </a></h2>
<p>If you have a Notice which names some, but not all, of the occupiers, you have the option to use it to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/evicting-tenants/section-21-and-section-8-notices">end the tenancy with the disqualified person(s)</a> under section 8 of the Housing Act 1988.</p>

<p>To do this you should:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li>fill in a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/assured-tenancy-forms#form-3">‘notice seeking possession of a property let on an assured tenancy or an assured agricultural occupancy’.</a></li>
<li>give between 2 weeks’ and 2 months’ notice depending on which terms of the tenancy they’ve broken</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/possession-claim-online-recover-property">apply to the court for a possession order</a> if your tenants don’t leave by the specified date.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find more information about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/evicting-tenants/section-21-and-section-8-notices">ending a tenancy under section 8.</a> </p>

<p>You may transfer the tenancy to someone else, once the disqualified person has left. You can do this using a deed of assignment.</p>

<p>If you have reasonable cause to believe that other occupiers are also disqualified from renting you can <a href="https://lcs-prototype.herokuapp.com/">ask the Home Office for a Notice naming them.</a> If all occupiers are then named on a Notice, or multiple Notices, you can <a href="#all">end the tenancy without a court order.</a> </p>

<p>If the tenancy is for a fixed term you can end it under section 33E of the Immigration Act 2014. If the fixed term has not yet expired, you can serve the disqualified person a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/evicting-tenants/section-21-and-section-8-notices">notice of seeking possession.</a> When this expires you can start court proceedings to take back your property. If the fixed term has expired and the disqualified person has not left your property, you can apply to the court for a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/evicting-tenants/possession-hearings-and-orders">possession order.</a></p>

			<h2 class="heading-medium"><a name="check">Check if a person is still disqualified from renting</a> </h2>

			<p>If you have received a Notice of Letting to a Disqualified Person to confirm that someone living in your property is disqualified from renting, you can <a href="#">check that the Notice is still valid.</a> You may wish to do this if some time has passed since it was issued and you want to use it now to end a tenancy.</p>

			<h2 class="heading-medium"><a name="tell">Tell the Home Office that a disqualified person has left your property</a></h2>
			<p><a href="https://lcs-prototype.herokuapp.com/">Let the Home Office know</a> when someone leaves your property following a Notice of Letting to a Disqualified Person. The Home Office will then update their records.</p>

			<h2 class="heading-medium"><a name="further">Further advice</a></h2>
			<p>Landlords and occupiers can seek legal advice from solicitors, housing advice centres or the <a href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/">Citizens Advice.</a></p>

			<p>Landlords can call the landlord’s helpline for general information about evicting a disqualified person. The helpline cannot talk about individual cases.</p>
